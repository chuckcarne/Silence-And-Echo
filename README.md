# Silence and Echo  

**Silence and Echo** is a C++ tool designed for testing and analyzing spoofed Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks using malformed UDP packets. This tool enables cybersecurity researchers and defenders to simulate attack scenarios for educational and defensive testing purposes.  

## Features  

- **Echo**: Spoofs the last digits of your IP address, making it appear as if your network is under a DDoS attack.  
- **Silence**: Allows setting a custom spoofed IP address, making the target believe the attack originates from a third party.  

## Installation  

### Prerequisites  
Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:  

- **G++** (for compiling C++ code)  
- **Nmap** (for network analysis)  
- **Python 3** (for running the script)  

### Setup  

1. **Install Dependencies** (Debian/Ubuntu-based systems):  
   ```sh
   sudo apt update && sudo apt install g++ nmap python3
Compile the C++ Files:

sh
Copy
g++ Echo.cpp -o Echo
g++ SilenceC.cpp -o Silence
Run the Script:

sh
Copy
sudo python3 Silence.py
Usage
Echo Mode:
Spoofs your subnet (e.g., xxx.xxx.xxx.XXX), making it appear as if your own network is under a DDoS attack.

Silence Mode:
Allows specifying a spoofed IP address, making the target system believe the attack originates from the chosen IP.

Platform Compatibility
Tested and confirmed working on:

Ubuntu

Kali Linux

Supports both Ethernet and WiFi networks.

⚠️ Disclaimer
This tool is intended strictly for:

Educational purposes

Cybersecurity research

Defensive testing

Unauthorized use of this tool to attack, disrupt, or deceive systems is illegal and unethical. Always ensure you have explicit permission before testing on any network. Use responsibly and in compliance with applicable laws.
